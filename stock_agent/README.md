# 📈 Stock Research Agent

## Context
This project implements a sophisticated **Stock Research Agent** designed to perform in-depth fundamental analysis by integrating real-time financial ratios and up-to-the-minute news aggregation. Built using the **Google Agentic Development Kit (ADK)**, this application demonstrates the power of autonomous AI agents in synthesizing complex, multi-source financial data for actionable insights.

The front-end is developed using **Gradio**, providing a simple, interactive, and shareable web interface.

* **Real-time News Aggregation:** Fetches and summarizes the latest relevant news articles and market sentiment for the selected company.
* **Interactive Gradio Interface:** A user-friendly web interface allowing instant input of stock tickers and clear presentation of the agent's findings.
